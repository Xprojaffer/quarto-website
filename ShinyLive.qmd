**Shinylive** is a framework that allows you to create serverless Shiny applications. Unlike traditional Shiny apps, which require an R server to execute the code, Shinylive runs entirely in the user's browser using WebAssembly. This makes it lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Pros of Shinylive

-   Cost-effective: No server costs, as everything runs in the browser.
-   Ease of sharing: Shareable via simple static files (e.g., HTML).
-   No server dependency: Works entirely offline once loaded in the browser.

## Cons of Shinylive

-   Limited resources: Performance depends on the user's browser, making it unsuitable for heavy computations.
-   Compatibility: Requires modern browsers with WebAssembly support.
-   Feature limitations: Some Shiny features may not be fully supported.

## Differences Between Shinylive and Traditional Shiny Apps

1.  **Hosting**:
    -   **Shiny Apps**: Require a server (e.g., RStudio Connect, Shiny Server) for hosting.
    -   **Shinylive**: Runs directly in the browser and does not need a server.
2.  **Performance**:
    -   **Shiny Apps**: Can handle large datasets and complex calculations thanks to server resources.
    -   **Shinylive**: Limited by the user's browser capabilities and may struggle with large datasets.
3.  **Deployment**:
    -   **Shiny Apps**: Require a hosting platform and proper server configuration.
    -   **Shinylive**: Can be shared as static HTML files and hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages.
