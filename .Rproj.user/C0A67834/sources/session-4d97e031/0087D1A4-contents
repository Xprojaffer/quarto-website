## Problem Definition

-   The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global public health and socio-economic systems. Understanding and analyzing COVID-19 data is crucial for developing informed public policies, improving healthcare responses, and mitigating future outbreaks. However, raw COVID-19 datasets often contain inconsistencies, missing values, and errors, which can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making.

**Why is the issue significant?**

-   Accurate COVID-19 data is essential for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to make evidence-based decisions. Incomplete or inaccurate data can lead to flawed analyses, misallocation of resources, and ineffective public health interventions. By improving data quality through comprehensive cleaning and wrangling techniques, we can enhance the reliability of research outcomes and provide actionable insights for future pandemic preparedness and response.

**What gap in knowledge does it address?**

-   Despite the abundance of COVID-19 data, there is a lack of standardized methods for cleaning and preparing these datasets for analysis. Existing studies often overlook the impact of poor data quality on analytical outcomes, leading to discrepancies in findings. This research addresses the gap by providing a systematic approach to data cleaning and preparation, ensuring that future analyses are based on consistent and accurate datasets. This will contribute to more reliable public health strategies and a better understanding of pandemic trends.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global public health and socio-economic systems.

## Research Objectives

1.  **To evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 safety measures**\
    Analyze how well safety protocols (e.g., mask-wearing, sanitization) are followed and their impact on customer perceptions.

2.  **To identify patterns in customer compliance with COVID-19 preventive behaviors**\
    Investigate variables related to customer adherence to safety guidelines, including failures to follow safety protocols and their frequency.

3.  **To assess the relationship between perceived safety and actual compliance in public settings**\
    Explore how perceptions of safety in public places, like coffee shops, correlate with actual observed behaviors and safety failures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Importance of the Topic

-   Accurate analysis of COVID-19 data is crucial for understanding public behavior and the effectiveness of safety measures during the pandemic. This research focuses on cleaning and preparing large datasets to ensure precise and meaningful insights.
-   The findings can aid policymakers, public health officials, and businesses in identifying areas where compliance with COVID-19 protocols may falter and where interventions are most needed.
-   By ensuring high-quality data, we can improve future pandemic responses, reduce misinformation, and enhance public trust in safety measures. Furthermore, understanding patterns in compliance behavior is essential for developing targeted strategies to increase adherence to health guidelines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods

### Sampling and Data Collection

-   The dataset was derived from a comprehensive survey assessing customer compliance with COVID-19 safety measures at hospitality establishments. The final sample size after cleaning is **736** unique participants. The data collection process included responses on mask-wearing behavior, social distancing adherence, and perceived safety levels. Participants were filtered based on key behavioral indicators and quality checks to ensure robust and reliable data.

### Data Wrangling and Preparation

-   **- Filtering and Cleaning:** Removed incomplete responses and invalid records on mask-wearing and social distancing.
-   \- **Recoding Variables:** Created binary indicators for safety failures (mask, vaccination, and social distancing).
-   \- **Handling Missing Values:** Applied case-wise deletion for critical missing data.
-   \- **Final Dataset:** 736 observations reflecting compliance behaviors and perceived safety.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RQ1 / H1 (Jaffer)

-   **Research Question 1 (RQ1):**\
    How do customer perceptions of COVID-19 safety measures influence compliance behaviors in public spaces?
